- Feature Branches -> In an ideal world there are lot of feature branches. Enhancements of the apllication can be done by creating the featute branches.
- main Branch -> Active Development would be going on here, this can be used to adding little changes.
- Release Branches -> this can have certain versions, and these versions are released to production from the release branches.
- Hotfix Branches -> this is used for customer issues (critical bugs that are detected in production release), fixing the code and promoting the changes to all other branches.
