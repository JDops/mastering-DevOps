- If u want to modify jenkins file without commiting it on gitrepo - then navigate to Pipeline- select one of the build -> replay -> edit and run
-  **Restart from stage** - Go to specific build -> dropdown -> Restart from stage -> BY this u can run a specific stage and this will skip other stages.


**Trigger Jenkins Build Automatically**
As a best practice to use both webhook and polling, as webhooks are sometimes unreliable.
