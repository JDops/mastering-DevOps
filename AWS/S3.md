- **Buckets must have a globally unique name (accross all regions)**
- **Buckets are defined at the region level.**
- **S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region.**

### Naming convention for S3:

- Bucket names must be between 3 (min) and 63 (max) characters long.
- Bucket names can consist only of lowercase letters, numbers, dots (.), and hyphens (-).
- Bucket names must begin and end with a lowercase letter or number.
- Not an IP
- No underscore, no uppercase.

- **Objects (files) have key, and key is the full path.**
- **Max Object size is 5TB.**
- **If uploading file greater than 5TB, then use multi part upload.**
- **For cross account access, use bucket policy.**
- **If u get 403 forbidden error, make sure the bucket policy allows public reads.**
- **Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version "null".**
- **Suspending versioning will not delete the previous version.**

  ### S3 Replication:
- **CRR** (Cross Region Replication) - Buckets in Different regions
- **SRR** (Same Region Replication) - Buckets in same region.
- **Versioning must be enabled in both source and destination buckets.**
- **Asynchronous Replication**
- **After you enable replication, only new objects are replicated.**
- **If u want to replicate existing objects use, S3 batch replication.**
- There is **no chaining** in replication.
