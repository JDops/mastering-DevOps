## Different types of apiGroups
In Kubernetes, API groups are used to organize and categorize resources within the Kubernetes API. Different API groups allow for versioning and modular organization of resources. Here are some commonly used API groups in Kubernetes:

1. **Core API Group (`""` or `"/v1"`):**
   - The core API group contains fundamental resources like Pods, Services, ReplicationControllers, and Secrets.
   - Example: `apiGroups: [""]` or `apiGroups: ["/v1"]`

2. **Apps API Group (`"apps"`):**
   - The "apps" API group includes resources related to higher-level abstractions for managing applications, such as Deployments, DaemonSets, ReplicaSets, and StatefulSets.
   - Example: `apiGroups: ["apps"]`

3. **Extensions API Group (`"extensions"`):**
   - The "extensions" API group was historically used for certain higher-level resources but is being deprecated in favor of the "apps" and other groups.
   - Example: `apiGroups: ["extensions"]`

4. **Batch API Group (`"batch"`):**
   - The "batch" API group includes resources for handling batch processing, such as Jobs and CronJobs.
   - Example: `apiGroups: ["batch"]`

5. **Networking API Group (`"networking.k8s.io"`):**
   - The "networking.k8s.io" API group includes resources for networking, like Ingress.
   - Example: `apiGroups: ["networking.k8s.io"]`

6. **Storage API Group (`"storage.k8s.io"`):**
   - The "storage.k8s.io" API group includes resources related to storage, such as StorageClasses and PersistentVolumeClaims.
   - Example: `apiGroups: ["storage.k8s.io"]`

7. **RBAC API Group (`"rbac.authorization.k8s.io"`):**
   - The "rbac.authorization.k8s.io" API group includes resources related to Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), such as Roles and ClusterRoles.
   - Example: `apiGroups: ["rbac.authorization.k8s.io"]`

8. **Authentication API Group (`"authentication.k8s.io"`):**
   - The "authentication.k8s.io" API group includes resources related to authentication mechanisms.
   - Example: `apiGroups: ["authentication.k8s.io"]`

9. **Authorization API Group (`"authorization.k8s.io"`):**
   - The "authorization.k8s.io" API group includes resources related to authorization mechanisms.
   - Example: `apiGroups: ["authorization.k8s.io"]`

These are some of the core and well-known API groups in Kubernetes. As Kubernetes evolves, new API groups may be introduced to support additional features and extensions. When creating RBAC roles or cluster roles, understanding the relevant API group for the resources you are managing is crucial for specifying the correct rules.
